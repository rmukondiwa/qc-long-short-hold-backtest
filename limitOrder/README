# Conditional Limit-Order Long–Short Strategy (QuantConnect)

This directory contains a version of the same long–short strategy that only enters positions when price thresholds relative to the first trading day are reached.

---

## Overview

- **Backtest period:** June 1, 2024 to June 1, 2025  
- **Starting capital:** $1,000,000  
- **Reference prices:** GOOG and AMZN closing prices from the first trading day.
- **Entry rules:**
  - Buy 3,000 GOOG if price falls 5% below the reference level.
  - Short 4,000 AMZN if price rises 5% above the reference level.
- **Risk rule:** Liquidate all positions if portfolio value drops more than $100,000 from the starting capital.

## Implementation Notes

- Day-one prices are stored once and used to compute the limit levels.
- Limit orders are submitted a single time and remain active until filled or the strategy exits.
- With daily data, the “first touch” of a price level is approximated using Lean’s fill model.
