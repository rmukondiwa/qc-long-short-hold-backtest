# Market-Order Long–Short Hold Strategy (QuantConnect)

This directory contains a QuantConnect Lean algorithm that implements a long–short buy-and-hold strategy using market orders.

---

## Overview

- **Backtest period:** June 1, 2024 to June 1, 2025
- **Starting capital:** $1,000,000
- **Initial positions:**
  - Long 3,000 shares of GOOG
  - Short 4,000 shares of AMZN
- **Risk rule:** The portfolio is checked daily and fully liquidated if total value falls more than $100,000 below the starting level.

---

## Implementation Notes

- The strategy enters once and then holds until either the stop is triggered or the backtest ends.
- Portfolio drawdown is measured using `Portfolio.TotalPortfolioValue`.
- Because the data resolution is daily, market orders submitted at the close are converted to Market-On-Open orders for the next trading session.
