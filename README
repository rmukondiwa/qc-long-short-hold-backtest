# qc-long-short-hold-backtest

This repository contains two QuantConnect Lean implementations of a long–short equity strategy that differ only in how trades are entered: immediate market execution versus conditional limit orders.

---

## Strategy Summary

Both versions:

- Trade GOOG and AMZN.
- Start with $1,000,000 in capital.
- Run from June 1, 2024 to June 1, 2025.
- Enter fixed positions:
  - Long 3,000 shares of GOOG.
  - Short 4,000 shares of AMZN.
- Monitor portfolio value daily and liquidate if equity falls more than $100,000 from the starting level.

## Implementations

### marketOrder/
Enters both positions immediately using market orders and holds until the drawdown rule is triggered or the backtest ends.

### limitOrder/
Records first-day prices and only enters positions when GOOG falls 5% and AMZN rises 5% from those levels using limit orders.

## How to Run

1. Create a Python project on QuantConnect.
2. Paste one of the strategy files into the main script.
3. Run a backtest and review the results.
